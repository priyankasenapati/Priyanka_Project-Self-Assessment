# Priyanka_Project-Self-Assessment

## Project Self and Team Assessment:

#####It all came together pretty well just before the presentation!

#####  We were three team members, Thi, Rajat and me. We started off with brainstorming different project ideas. Some of the ideas we short listed were Stock Price Prediction, COVID-19 Prediction, Divorce Prediction. I was inclined to pick the Stock Price Prediction project because it would have made us learn more about how the stock and financial markets operate and what factors influence them. Many of us will be working in financial firms and being knowledgeable in these areas would be beneficial professionally. COVID 19 project was also an interesting concept and was based on the current pandemic crisis. But during the beginning of our project there wasn’t enough data available. Finally the Divorce Prediction project was selected. Even though that had not been my first choice, I still fully committed to it since my other group members had chosen it.

##### I was responsible for organizing the meetings and assigning the tasks. All of us worked took responsibility for different parts of the project, but also agreed that we will also work on the parts not assigned to us for our own learning and practice. We would then review and finally pickup pieces for each other to put together the final deliverable. Thi had done a good job researching for datasets and choose the one we finally used. Even though the dataset was not very large, it provide enough features to create two different models which had an accuracy of 100%. We had regular meetings to discuss the technical aspects, progress and also decide on the presentation format. Our team worked together very professionally without any conflicts. We could discuss diverse ideas and could converge and decide one one and more on to the next problem.

I was under a lot of pressure since I had just come back from dealing with a personal health problem. I was working double time on submitting my modules so that I could complete all my deliverables by the end of the course. But this project was very interesting and I kept going full speed on it. I decided to focus on the Training, Testing, Evaluation, Model Creation and Inference. I decided to model the deliverables as if it were a real product to maximize my learning. I felt very satisfied in the end. I had created the tools a data scientist would use to analyze the data, create a model and then export it out. I had also created the Web application with the inference engine that could read the exported model and make predictions when new users answered the questions on the website.

We had multiple meeting the last few days leading to the presentation. We decided on the final pieces we will put together from each of our programs and how to organize the presentation. We then worked through GitHub to share and integrate our code so that our final application was tested and ready for the demo. Each of us worked in parallel to update the slides. Ten it was presentation time. I think we all presented very well. I had created 5 slides for my part.

Teamwork
The fact that we divided the tasks and assigned responsibility to each team member early on helped a lot in the execution of the project. Everyone was willing to help and unstuck each other or jump on a call at a short notice. Some of the decisions we took as a team, for example, deliver your part but also work on other parts and then we can decide which part will be picked from who, allowed us to pick the best pieces from each other’s work and showcase a strong product.

Organization
This went pretty smoothly. We had frequent meetings, chats etc. We were able to jump on a call and take quick decisions without any conflict. Every one was ready to pitch in to make the project a great success.

Challenges and improvements
There were no big road blocks. One of the things I would suggest as an improvement would be to take a project with a huge data set. Dealing with very large datasets have their own issues and would provide a great learning experience for all.

Recommendations
Recommendation would be to extend the chosen project to create a mobile app for divorce prediction. As a product, it would provide more exposure and attract more people to use it and make it viral.
